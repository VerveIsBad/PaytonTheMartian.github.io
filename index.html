        <div id='about-me-text' style='display: none;'>
            <p>I enjoy programming, playing video games, and pretty much everything about Linux.</p>
            
            <hr>
            
            <p>I have been programming since around 2017-ish, and in that time, I've been able to become very experienced with programming logic, and I've become advanced with a couple programming languages.</p>
            <p>I'm comfortable using and personally enjoy the following languages:</p>
            <ui>
                <li>Python 3.7>=</li>
                <li>HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript (+jQuery)</li>
                <li>Haxe</li>
                <li>Java 16</li>
            </ui>

            <p>Along with the above, I use the following systems and APIs quite often:</p>
            <ui>
                <li>Minecraft Fabric Mod Loader (Java 16)</li>
                <li>Terraria tModLoader (C# and .NET)</li>
                <li>HaxeFlixel (Haxe)</li>
                <li>Godot (GDScript and C#)</li>
            </ui>

            <p>I've also been working on a game, made in Godot. It's a small rhythm game that's pretty similar to JSAB. As in, lasers and players. Pretty simple.</p>
            <p>I won't say much about the game, because it's a pretty big WIP, and I don't even know if it'll become large enough (Or polished enough) for me to feel confient to release it.</p>

            <hr>

            <p>As for video games, there are a couple games I play that I find very enjoyable.</p>
            <p>I guess a list of games that I play most often would make sense, so here ya' go:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Beat Saber</li>
                <li>Minecraft</li>
                <li>Terraria</li>
                <li>osu!mania</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Ordered by how much I play the game.</p>

            <hr>

            <p>Finally, I have been using Linux since about 2018, and I have used it on my personal laptop for, well, since I got it.</p>
            <p>I have used a few Linux distrobutions. Notably Ubuntu, Debian, and Arch Linux.</p>
            <p>I've not only just used the distrobutions, but when I install them, I always install them without a graphical environment, and as minimally as possible. Which means no `sudo` until I install it.</p>
            <p>Because of the above, I've grown to be particularly advanced with the installation, setup, and configuration of X.org and Wayland, and their many window managers.</p>
            <p>I personally use i3, AwesomeWM, and Sway most often, and I can set them up and configure them quite well.</p>

            <hr>

            <p>Well that was a lot of text, there is no TL;DR, maybe I'll make one some day. No idea.</p>
