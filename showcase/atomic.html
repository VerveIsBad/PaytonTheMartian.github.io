                    <p>The Python modding platform.</p>
                    <p>Atomic is a modding API for Python, made to be fast and simple.</p>
                    
                    <h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
                    <p>To include Atomic in your project, add the <code>atomic</code> folder to your project's root folder. Then copy the <code>mods/</code> folder as well.</p>
                    <p>Next, add the following lines to your main file, or where your app/game gets initalized (Right before running the app/game):</p>
<pre><code>from atomic import loader
loader.load_mods([
    'examplemod',
    # other mods to load.
])</code></pre>
                    <p>Just like that, you've added Atomic.</p>
                    <p>Atomic will need some setup a well, in <code>mods/basemod/</code>, make some files and functions that can be called from other locations in your app/game. This way modders can hook into the Base Mod and in turn, mod your app/game.</p>
                    
                    <h2 id="modding">Modding</h2>
                    <p>The modding system of Atomic is intentionally small and simple.</p>
                    <p>To make a mod, there are only a few steps.</p>
                    <p>First, make a new folder in the <code>mods</code> folder. Make sure to use underscores rather than spaces. You can use <kbd>a-Z</kbd>, <kbd>0-9</kbd>, and <kbd>_</kbd>. Note that the folder&#39;s name cannot start with a number.</p>
                    
                    <p>Then, make a new <code>__init__.py</code> file inside your mod folder. This file gets executed when your mod is imported, so don&#39;t write much top-level code. Try to only use imports at the top-level.</p>
                    
                    <p>Inside this <code>__init__.py</code> file, make three new functions. <code>on_load(basemod)</code>, <code>post_load(basemod, mods)</code>, and <code>get_name()</code>.</p>
                    
                    <p><code>on_load(basemod)</code> is called when your mod is loaded, not all mods are loaded yet, so only basemod is provided in the args. This function has no return values.</p>
                    <p><code>post_load(basemod, mods)</code> is called after all mods are loaded, so both basemod and all mods can be provided as arguments. This function also has no return values.</p>
                    <p><code>get_name()</code> is called any time something needs to get the name of your mod. The return value of this function is the name of your mod.</p>
                    
                    <h2 id="projects-examples">Projects & Examples</h2>
                    <p>If you make a project or an example using Atomic, let me know and I can put it here!</p>
                    <p>Nothing is here yet!</p>
